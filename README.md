Hi I am Poonam Thakur, Assistant Professor at IISER-Thiruvananthapuram, India
I work on mouse models of Parkinson's disease. We use ML tools to identify the mouse motor behaviors that can predict the disease course. 
Reach out to me on poonam@iisertvm.ac.in if you are interested in collaborating or learning more.
